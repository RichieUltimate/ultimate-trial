## Installation

In this repository, you may find a patch to be able to play Ultimate trial on your console.

You can use this link to patch the mod: 
https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php. 

If patching for Wii, you can use this, and provide the WAD:
https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/

This game is free. If you bought it, you've been scammed.

You need the rom and the patch.

- The N64/Emulator patch needs to be applied to the OoT US 1.0 ROM.
- The Wii VC patch needs to be applied to the Ocarina of Time US WAD.

This mod is compatible with most emulators, hardware and Wii. For the best possible experience, **I recommend using the hardware or emulator.**
  - Please note that although it is possible to finish the game on Wii, **the Motion Blur is incompatible** and is therefore **disabled on Wii.**
  - The game is **NOT compatible on Bizhawk**. Several freezes and crashes have been observed while using this emulator.
  - There might be some little lags on N64. There are some z-fighting on some textures, on some scenes.
  - Playing on N64 hardware **requires the Expansion Pak**.
