## Installation

In this repository, you may find a patch to be able to play Ultimate trial on your console.

You can use this link to patch the mod: 
https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php. 

If patching for Wii, you can use this, and provide the WAD:
https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/

This game is free. If you bought it, you've been scammed.

You need the rom and the patch.

- The N64/Emulator patch needs to be applied to the OoT US 1.0 ROM.<br>
(can be labeled as U 1.0, NTSC 1.0 or Rev 0)<br>
md5 hash: `5bd1fe107bf8106b2ab6650abecd54d6`
- The Wii VC patch needs to be applied to the Ocarina of Time US WAD.

This mod is compatible with most emulators, hardware and Wii. For the best possible experience, **I recommend using the hardware or emulator.**
  - Please note that although it is possible to finish the game on Wii, **the Motion Blur is incompatible** and is therefore **disabled on Wii.**
  - The game is **NOT compatible on Bizhawk**. Several freezes and crashes have been observed while using this emulator.
  - There might be some little lags on N64. There are some z-fighting on some textures, on some scenes.
  - Playing on N64 hardware **requires the Expansion Pak**.

## Difficulty

**Easy**:
- You lose half as much health when hit.
- Enemies are usually weaker and limited to the most basic types when Randologic is enabled.

**Regular**:
- Standard difficulty with balanced damage and enemy behavior.
- Enemy selection through Randologic is balanced, offering a fair mix of weak and strong enemies.

**Difficult**:
- You take twice as much damage when attacked.
- Bosses have twice as much health.
- Some bosses have stronger attacks.
- Certain enemies, like Stalfos, can attack you simultaneously when you target them.
- Stronger enemies are more likely to appear with Randologic enabled, even early in the game.

## Randologic

Three modes are available:

- Disabled
- Thematic
- Chaotic

You can select your preferred mode when creating your save file, or directly from the Stronghold menu.

**Disabled Mode**

No randomization is applied â€” enemies always remain the same and are never shuffled.

**Thematic Mode**

Enemies are shuffled each time you enter a Trial room, but only among those that match the theme of the current Trial.
For example:

- A Dodongo can appear in any room of the Dodongo Cavern Trial, but it will not appear inside the Deku Tree Trial.

**Chaotic Mode**

Enemies can appear in any room, regardless of their original area or theme â€” with a few exceptions to prevent bugs or soft locks.
You might even encounter an Iron Knuckle at the very beginning of the game.

**ðŸ’¡ Notes:**

- Some enemies wonâ€™t appear early in the game to prevent possible soft locks.
- Each mode has been designed with a progressive difficulty that scales with your in-game progress, ensuring a balanced and enjoyable experience.
- Enemies can be adjusted and selected based on the chosen difficulty. The higher the difficulty level, the greater the chances of encountering stronger enemies.

## Compatibility

The game has been tested with : 
- Project64
- Simple64
- N64
- Dolphin
- RetroArch
- Ares
